README for Titanic Survival PredictionThis Python script is designed to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. It uses a RandomForestClassifier from the sklearn.ensemble module to make predictions based on passenger data.
DependenciesThe script requires the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
DataThe data used in this script is from the Titanic Kaggle competition. It includes two CSV files: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv file contains passenger data along with survival information, which is used to train the model. The test.csv file contains passenger data for which the survival is predicted.
Usage- Install the required libraries: numpy, pandas, and sklearn.
- Download the Titanic dataset from the Kaggle competition page.
- Update the file paths in the script to point to the location of your downloaded train.csv and test.csv files.
- Run the script. It will train the model on the training data and then use the trained model to predict the survival of passengers in the test data.
OutputThe script generates a pandas DataFrame named output that contains the PassengerId from the test data and the corresponding survival prediction (Survived).
NoteThe script includes commented-out code for downloading the Titanic dataset directly from Kaggle and for saving the output DataFrame to a CSV file. Uncomment and use these lines as needed.
Additional InformationThe script uses the pandas.get_dummies() function to convert categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables. This is particularly useful for handling categorical features like passenger class and sex in the Titanic dataset.
